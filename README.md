# Wordpress-admin-bar-toggle
Easily switch of the admin bar on the frontend when needed, in my experiences it was often in my way with fixed headers.

After adding the snippet in your functions.php you will have a subtle black button in the right bottom corner, this button will only be shown on the frontend.
